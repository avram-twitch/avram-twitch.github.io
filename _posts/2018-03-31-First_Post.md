Welcome to my new website! 

I figured that it was about time I have some sort of online presence!

With this blog, I will document my progress, learning, interests, and ideas with
respect to programming. I also hope to explore and visualize interesting
datasets that I may come across. If nothing else, I want this blog to be
a journal of my progress and interests. But hopefully it can be useful and
interesting to others!

I built this website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I like it for two
reasons: 

1. I can maintain it entirely from my laptop, via the command line
2. It's really simple! I don't have to mess with databases or javascript, if
   I don't want to. 

This website will get a little fancier in the future. But I want to avoid using
anything in this site that I don't understand. So, for now, it will be pretty
bare bones!

Anyway, here's a random code sample, just to test out code snippets with jekyll.

{% highlight python linenos %}
print('Hello World!')
{% endhighlight %}
