Welcome to my new website! 

I figured that it was about time I have some sort of online presence. I will
soon be starting a masters degree in computer science at the University of Utah.
Thus far, I have been almost entirely self-taught in coding and programming.
I came to learn both Python and R across a few internships and personal
projects. 

On this blog, I will explore my progress, learning, interests, and ideas with
respect to programming. I also hope to explore and visualize interesting
datasets that I come across. If nothing else, I want this blog to be a journal
of my progress and interests. But hopefully it can be useful and interesting to
others!

I built this website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I like it for two
reasons: 

1. I can maintain it entirely from my laptop, via the command line!
2. It's really simple! I don't have to mess with anything crazy like databases
   and javascript, if I don't want to. 
   
This website will get a little fancier in the future. But I want to avoid
including anything in this site that I don't understand. So, for
now, it will be pretty bare bones!

Anyway, here's a random code sample, just to test out code snippets with jekyll.

{% highlight python linenos %}
print('Hello World!')
{% endhighlight %}
