Welcome to my new website! 

I figured that it was about time I have some sort of online presence. I will
soon be starting a masters degree in computer science at the University of Utah.
Thus far, I have been almost entirely self-taught in coding and programming.
Whenever there was an excuse at any of my past internships to use programming,
I jumped at the opportunity.This is how I came to learn both python and R.

On this blog, I will explore my progress, learning, interests, and ideas with
programming. I also hope to explore and visualize interesting datasets that
I come across. If nothing else, I want this blog to be a journal of my progress
and interests. But hopefully it can be useful and interesting to others!

I built this website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I like it for two
reasons: First, I can maintain it entirely from the command line, and Second,
it's really simple! I don't have to mess with anything crazy like databases and
javascript, if I don't want to. I hope to be able to make this website a little
fancier in the future, but I want to avoid including anything in this site that
I don't understand how it works. So, for now, it will be pretty bare bones!

Anyway, here's a random code sample, just to test out code snippets with jekyll.

{% highlight python linenos %}
print('Hello World!')
{% endhighlight %}
