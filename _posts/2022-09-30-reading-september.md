## [Collected Poems, 1909-1962](https://www.amazon.com/T-Eliot-Collected-1909-1962-Centenary/dp/0151189781) by T.S. Eliot

More poetry, but Eliot is no Emily Dickinson.
He is an entirely different beast.
Dickinson, while often elusive, is on the whole pretty accessible, especially for her more well-known poems.
With T.S. Eliot, you have to read carefully, reread, and for some of his more difficult poems, reread a heavily annotated version explaining his many references.
This is by no means "light" reading, you have to be prepared to be baffled and work at it.
It would also probably help to know some Italian, Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and German.

Actually, to start off with, Eliot is not too bad.
[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/44212/the-love-song-of-j-alfred-prufrock) is one of my favorite poems of all time.
While it's still enigmatic and haunting, it is relatively easy to understand its basic ideas.
And it has some _great_ lines:

  Do I dare
  Disturb the universe?
  In a minute there is time
  For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

  I grow old ... I grow old ...
  I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.
  
  Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?
  I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
  I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.
  
  I do not think that they will sing to me.
 
But then you get to his later poems, and things get more and more recondite and obscure.
It's almost like he's playing a game with the reader: "Let's see how many rabbit holes we can send the reader down".

The ~~biggest offender~~ greatest poem ever, and Eliot's _magnum opus_, is the modernist classic _The Wasteland_.
Here's a poem that I was desperate to "figure out", and after five complete read throughs I think I'm getting the gist of it.
But wow, there is a lot going on.
This Eliot guy is mashing together [the Buddhist Fire Sermon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80dittapariy%C4%81ya_Sutta),
[Paradise Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost),
classic Greek writing,
[popular rag time tunes](https://wasteland.windingway.org/128/that-shakespeherian-rag),
[references to ancient roman battles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mylae),
[confessions of St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_(Augustine)).
He's all caught up in a stream of consciousness that jumps between a girl visiting Germany,
a dead Phoenician sailor in the land of the dead,
Cleopatra sitting on a throne (I think),
prostitutes arguing with each other,
and the voice of God.
There is Greek, Latin, German, Sanskrit, and mercifully English
