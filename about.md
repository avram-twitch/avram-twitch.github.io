# Avram Twitchell

My name is Avram Twitchell. I am a current Computer Science graduate student at the University of Utah. I love coding, statistics, economics, and diving into data! 

I studied economics at Brigham Young University, graduating with my bachelors
in 2016. I worked for two years with the Fixed Income Investments team at
Deseret Mutual Benefits Administrators. While there, I conducted credit and risk
analysis, as well as purchasing over $500 million in Corporate bonds, commercial
paper, and options.

Outside of my studies and work, I am an avid reader. I love reading all genres,
both fiction and nonfiction, but I especially love classic literature. I also
enjoy going to concerts, visiting art exhibits, and hiking Utah's many majestic
mountains.

I am currently based in Lehi, Utah, with my wife.
